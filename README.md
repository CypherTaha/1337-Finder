## 1337 Finder

This tiny project was made to practice the basic stuff we've learned in Born2beroot project at 1337 school. It was created using Bash, and it can be executed only in the school's iMacs since it's not linked to 42 API, but imagine if we could do that? Crazy.


### The benefits of the script?

When you choose someone to evaluate your project, the intranet hides the student's phone number after 10 mins and you will not be able to see their phone number anymore to call them. So, the main issue this script solves is to get students' phone numbers with some perks such as to check if the user is freezed or not, or to get their full name.

### How to run the script?

Paste this command line in your terminal to run the script directly from the repository:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilyassesalama/1337-Finder/main/userdata.sh)
```

### Contributions?

I welcome contributions, the script task is simple but if you wish to improve the code then why not. I never had any experience in Bash before, so yeah.
