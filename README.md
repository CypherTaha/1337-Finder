## 1337 Finder

This tiny project was made to practice the basic stuff we've learned in Born2beroot project at 1337 school. It was created using Bash, and it can be executed only in the school's iMacs since it's not linked to 42 API, but imagine if we could do that? Crazy.


### The benefits of the the script?

When you choose someone to evaluate your project, the intranet hides the student's phone number and you will not be able to see their phone number anymore to call them. So, the main issue this script solves is to get students' phone numbers with some perks such as check if the user is freezed or not or to get their full name.

### Contributions?

I welcome contributions, the script task is simple but if you wish to improve the code then why not. I never had any experience in Bash before, so this is my first script ever.
